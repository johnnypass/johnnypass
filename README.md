# Hi, I'm John Passmore

I'm a Senior Product and Data Leader working at the intersection of metadata, streaming infrastructure, and journalism technology. My work focuses on building systems that turn content into data products—serving internal stakeholders, external partners, and the public good.

I lead teams at New York Public Radio working on livestream analytics, audio metadata systems, and platform integrations. I'm also a trained archivst and conservator, I build data tools, and occasionally write about cultural memory, and the stories that live inside our systems.

This GitHub is a collection of small experiments, proofs of concept, and cloud functions—many related to:

- **Streaming Audio Infrastructure** – testing live metadata injection, listener analytics, and failover monitoring
- **Data Pipelines & Automation** – cloud functions and scripts for working with APIs like YouTube, Salesforce, and Redshift
- **Audience Intelligence** – backend support for dashboards, reporting pipelines, and ETL workflows

**Core Skills:**  
`SQL` · `Python` · `AWS Lambda / Redshift` · `Google Cloud Functions` · `ETL Design` · `Metadata Architecture` · `BI Tools (Tableau, Looker)`

**Also Me:**  
I’ve written about everything from **experimental radio** to **vintage ska tapes**, mostly for WNYC:
