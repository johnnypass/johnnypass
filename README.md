# John Passmore

I'm a Senior Product and Data Leader working at the intersection of metadata, streaming infrastructure, and journalism technology. My work focuses on building systems that turn content into data products: serving internal stakeholders, external partners, and the public good.

I lead teams at New York Public Radio working on livestream analytics, audio metadata systems, and platform integrations. I'm also a trained archivist and conservator, I build data tools, and I occasionally write about cultural memory and the stories that live inside our systems.

This GitHub is a collection of small experiments, proofs of concept, and cloud functions, many related to:

- **Streaming Audio Infrastructure** – testing live metadata injection, listener analytics, and failover monitoring
- **Data Pipelines & Automation** – cloud functions and scripts for working with APIs like YouTube, Salesforce, and Redshift
- **Audience Intelligence** – backend support for dashboards, reporting pipelines, and ETL workflows

**Selected Projects**
- [**Data Visualization Portfolio – Tableau Public**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/john.passmore/vizzes)  
  Dashboards and exploratory visualizations focused on audience insights, content analysis, and platform performance.

- [**Observable Notebook – Music Metadata as Data Product**](https://observablehq.com/d/5faacba230189161)  
  Interactive prototype exploring structured music metadata from a CMS export—designed to support content discovery and archival reuse.

**Core Skills:**  
`SQL` · `Python` · `AWS Lambda / Redshift` · `Google Cloud Functions` · `ETL Design` · `Metadata Architecture` · `BI Tools (Tableau, Looker)` · `Taxonomy` · `Archives` · `Digital Asset Management`

**Also Me:**  
I’ve written about everything from **experimental radio** to the **Watergate break in**, mostly for WNYC:

**Also Me, in Bands**

I’ve played in a few bands over the years: equal parts art project, noise experiment, and metadata case study.

- [**Shrouded Strangers**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/58cjoOHDt29DjVB7MTZYC9) – Slop Rock
- [**Nethers**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2a5BrRoYd3nzBkoeF8ZUPx) – Folk, I guess!
- [**Carlsonics**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2ouBfsiX71lEnc020vd5WN) – Sounds like Midnight Oil

These projects inform how I think about audio, rights metadata, digital distribution, and the cultural shelf life of weird sounds.

Thanks for stopping by!
