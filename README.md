# John Passmore

Hello! I'm a Senior Product and Data Leader working on streaming infrastructure, media distribtuion, archives, metadata, and journalism technology. My work focuses on serving internal stakeholders, external partners, and the public good.

I lead teams at New York Public Radio working on audience analytics, audio distritbution systems, and platform integrations. I'm also a trained archivist and time-based media conservator. I occasionally write about cultural memory and the stories that live inside our systems.

This GitHub is a collection of experiments and proofs of concept, many related to:

- **Streaming Audio Infrastructure** – testing live metadata injection, listener analytics, and failover monitoring
- **Data Pipelines & Automation** – cloud functions and scripts for working with APIs like YouTube, Salesforce, and Redshift
- **Audience Intelligence** – backend support for dashboards, reporting pipelines, and ETL workflows

**Selected Projects**
- [**Data Visualization – Tableau Public**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/john.passmore/vizzes)  
  Dashboards and exploratory visualizations focused on audience insights, content analysis, and platform performance. 

- [**Observable Notebook**](https://observablehq.com/d/5faacba230189161)  
  Interactive prototype exploring the evolution of moving image technology since the introduction of television in the home. 

- [**Livestream Metadata Checker**](https://tranquil-kangaroo-be0dff.netlify.app)
  A vibe coded app that was built for our teams to quickly check implementation of in-band metadata for HLS audio streams for a new audio player.

**Core Skills:**  
`SQL` · `Python` · `AWS Lambda / Redshift` · `Google Cloud Functions` · `ETL Design` · `Metadata Architecture` · `BI Tools (Tableau, Looker)` · `Taxonomy` · `Archives` · `Digital Asset Management`

**Also Me, in Bands**

I’ve played in a few bands over the years: equal parts art project, noise experiment, and metadata case study.
