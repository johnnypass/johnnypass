# John Passmore

I'm a Senior Product and Data Leader working at the intersection of streaming infrastructure, media distribtuion, archives, metadata and journalism technology. My work focuses on serving internal stakeholders, external partners, and the public good.

I lead teams at New York Public Radio working on audience analytics, audio distritbution systems, and platform integrations. I'm also a trained archivist and time-based media conservator. I occasionally write about cultural memory and the stories that live inside our systems.

This GitHub is a collection of experiments and proofs of concept, many related to:

- **Streaming Audio Infrastructure** – testing live metadata injection, listener analytics, and failover monitoring
- **Data Pipelines & Automation** – cloud functions and scripts for working with APIs like YouTube, Salesforce, and Redshift
- **Audience Intelligence** – backend support for dashboards, reporting pipelines, and ETL workflows

**Selected Projects**
- [**Data Visualization Portfolio – Tableau Public**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/john.passmore/vizzes)  
  Dashboards and exploratory visualizations focused on audience insights, content analysis, and platform performance.

- [**Observable Notebook – Music Metadata as Data Product**](https://observablehq.com/d/5faacba230189161)  
  Interactive prototype exploring structured music metadata from a CMS export—designed to support content discovery and archival reuse.

**Core Skills:**  
`SQL` · `Python` · `AWS Lambda / Redshift` · `Google Cloud Functions` · `ETL Design` · `Metadata Architecture` · `BI Tools (Tableau, Looker)` · `Taxonomy` · `Archives` · `Digital Asset Management`

**Also Me:**  
I’ve written about everything from **experimental radio** to the **Watergate break in**, mostly for WNYC:

I’ve played in a few bands over the years: equal parts art project, noise experiment, and metadata case study.
