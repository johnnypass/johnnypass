# John Passmore

Hello! 

I'm a Senior Product Director specializing in streaming infrastructure, systems integration, media distribution, data analytics, archival access, and journalism technology. I focus on building platforms that serve internal teams, external partners, and the public good.

At New York Public Radio, I lead teams working on audience analytics, audio distribution, dynamic ad technology, and platform integrations. I'm also a trained time-based media conservator and occasionally write about cultural memory and the stories living in the systems I help build.

This GitHub is a collection of experiments and proofs of concept, many related to:

- **Streaming Audio Infrastructure** – Testing live metadata injection, listener analytics, and failover monitoring
- **Data Pipelines & Automation** – Cloud functions and scripts for working with APIs like YouTube, Salesforce, and Redshift
- **Audience Intelligence** – Backend support for dashboards, reporting pipelines, and ETL workflows

**Selected Projects**

- [**Automated Chart Summaries with Lida + OpenAI}**
  A project that uses Lida (by Microsoft) and OpenAI to generate plain-language summaries of data visualizations. It explores how AI can make charts easier to understand and support   accessible data storytelling.
- [**PBCore**](https://pbcore.org)
  A cataloging standard for the description of audiovisual content, a data sharing tool, and much more.
- [**Livestream Metadata Checker**](https://tranquil-kangaroo-be0dff.netlify.app)
  A vibe-coded app for our teams to quickly check implementation of in-band metadata for HLS audio streams for a new audio player.
- [**Data Visualization – Tableau Public**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/john.passmore/vizzes)  
  Dashboards and exploratory visualizations based on open-source datasets from the VA and Kaggle. 
- [**Observable Notebook**](https://observablehq.com/d/5faacba230189161)  
  An interactive prototype exploring the evolution of moving image technology since the introduction of television in the home.
